# 👋 Hey, I'm Jayesh Bankoti

**Senior Staff Engineer | AI Architect | GenAI Systems | NLP Lead**

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm an AI engineer who thrives at the intersection of **AI**, **NLP**, **LLM fine-tuning**, and **efficient deployment**. 
I build NLP & GenAI systems that go beyond demos — from misinformation detection to persona-aligned assistants and optimised job clusters in Databricks.

## 🚀 Key Projects

### 🔒 [Private] BertTopic Optimised Clustering (ask for access)
**Narrative Intelligence Pipeline** using UMAP + HDBSCAN for unsupervised discourse clustering with external MongoDB queueing.

📌 *Ask me for access to view the private repo.*

### 🧙 [Potterhead GPT](https://github.com/jayeshbankoti007/potterhead-gpt)
Instruction-tuned, multi-persona LLM fine-tuned with QLoRA on 50K+ Q&A pairs. Characters like Snape, Dumbledore, and Kobe Bryant respond with tone and persona intact.  
✅ Domain pretraining on the full Harry Potter book corpus  
✅ Real-time token streaming via FastAPI backend

📌 Source code available in a private repo — request access if interested.

## 💡 What I Work On

- **Narrative detection pipelines** – using clustering, summarization, and LLMs for social media insight.
- **LLM tuning & deployment** – QLoRA, SFT, PEFT, persona injection, prompt chaining.
- **Infra & MLOps** – Delta tables, service principals, DBX, DABs, ONNX, FastAPI streaming.
- **Real-world scale** – Reduced infra costs by 40k USD/year, deployed narrative systems at scale.
